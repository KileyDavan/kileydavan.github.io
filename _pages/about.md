I am a PhD student in the Fulton lab at the University of Minnesota studing people's perceptions of genetic biocontrol and aquatic invasive species. Broadly, my research interests lie in the social and cultural aspects of conservation, particularly cognition (e.g., attitudes, beliefs, values, etc.) and theories (e.g., cognitive hierarchy) underlying human-wildlife relations. My interest stems from my curiosity to understand why people have certain attitudes and beliefs towards conservation and how we can foster more favorable attitudes, beliefs and behaviors. I hope that by sharing my passion for conservation and animals, I will instill it in others as well.

In my free time, I enjoy caring for my houseplants, hanging out with my dog and cat, crocheting, and listening to true crime podcasts. I also love bats and it is my personal mission to get others to love them too. Check out this video I made about bats:
